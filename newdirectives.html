<!-- Create New Directives
--------------------------

In addition to all the built-in AngularJS directives, you can create your own directives.

New directives are created by using the .directive function.

To invoke the new directive, make an HTML element with the same tag name as the new directive.

When naming a directive, you must use a camel case name, vitDirective, but when invoking it, you must use - separated name, vit-directive: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
<body ng-app="myApp">

        
     <vit-directive></vit-directive>
     
 </body>


 <script>
    var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
    app.directive("vitDirective", function() {
      return { 
        template : "<h1>Made by the VIT directive!</h1>"
      };
    });
  </script>


</html>
        

<!-- You can invoke a directive by using:

    Element name---- <vit-directive></vit-directive>
    
    Attribute------ <div vit-directive></div>
 
    Class ----------- <div class="vit-directive"></div>
    
    Comment------ directive: vit-directive  restrict : "M", replace : true,
