<!-- The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller).

The scope is an object with the available properties and methods.

The scope is available for both the view and the controller. -->

<!-- 
Root Scope

All applications have a $rootScope which is the scope created on the HTML element that contains the ng-app directive.

The rootScope is available in the entire application.

If a variable has the same name in both the current scope and in the rootScope, the application uses the one in the current scope.  -->
